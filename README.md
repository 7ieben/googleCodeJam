Google Code Jam Solutions
=========================

These are my solutions to the Google Code Jam problems found at code.google.com/codejam.
The solutions contain the sourcefiles as well as the sample input files provided by Google.
I only use Haskell, so you should be able to compile them with:

    ghc -o exe_path sourcefile_path

and run the program with

    ./exe_path inputfile.in

The output will end up in a file called inputfile.out.

TODO
----

- make main function a generic higher-order function
  - takes solve and process to read the file, solve the problem and write the output
