Google Code Jam Solutions
=========================

These are my solutions to the Google Code Jam problems found at code.google.com/codejam.
The solutions contain the sourcefiles as well as the sample input files provided by Google.
I only use Haskell, so you should be able to compile them with: 

  ghc -o exe_path sourcefile_path

and run the program with

    ./exe_path inputfile_path

The output will end up in a file called Output.out. This will be replaced with a soulution that uses the inputfile name with .out as the extension.
